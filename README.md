Vestibule
=========

This is the simple application that we used to build [Ruby Manor](http://rubymanor.org/) numbers [3](http://rubymanor.org/3/) and [4](http://rubymanor.org/4/). It's simple purpose is to collect talk proposals, and try to channel feedback and suggestions on those proposals into *useful forms*.

What do we consider to be *non-useful forms*? Any feedback that hasn't thoughtfully considered the proposal and tried to improve it. To put it bluntly, ["+1" is the Anti-Christ][plus-ones].


How to contribute
-----------------

Fork, patch, test, send a pull request. Apologies that the code and design are bit rough. Perhaps you can make it better?

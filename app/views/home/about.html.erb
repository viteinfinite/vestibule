  <%= page_title 'What is Vestibule?' %>

  <p>Vestibule is a tool to help us &mdash; the community &mdash; generate and prepare the contents of the day.</p>

  <p>The idea is simple. You propose a presentation. Others will help you refine and focus it by making <em>suggestions</em>. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.</p>

  <p>At some point (yet to be determined), we&rsquo;ll then collectively whittle down the set of proposals to those that have been selected for the day.</p>

  <h2>What is Ruby Manor?</h2>

  <p>Ruby Manor is a one-day, zero-bullshit fully-fledged conference about Ruby, the programming language.<p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s predicated on the belief that conferences don&rsquo;t need a lot of the ceremony and cruft that they&rsquo;ve acquired over the years. We don&rsquo;t need swag. We don&rsquo;t need fancy food. We just want to get together with like minded people and share ideas. We want to know <a href="/motivation">what motivates you</a>.</p>

  <p>Conferences aren&rsquo;t about buying a ticket and then forgetting about it, and turning up on the day expecting to be entertained. They&rsquo;re about engaging, participating, sharing ideas and challenging each other. Most of all, they&rsquo;re about what the community finds interesting, not about what the same old conference circuit speakers want to feed you.</p>
